## About this repository
This app built for showing how to cut html payload with service workers. (insipired by [this article](https://philipwalton.com/articles/smaller-html-payloads-with-service-workers/))

## Idea
Main idea is using service workers to caching only templates of the parts of the page (not contains data) and serving just content to feed those templates when browser sends request to server.

## How
* Server Configuration
  * `/` and `/trendyol` routes serve full html with content.
  * if this routes have `?contentOnly=true` parameter, they just sends the content of the page.
  * Serve templates.
  * `/template` send template of the `/` page.
  * `/trendyol/partials/:partial` sends multiple templates of the `/trendyol` page.
 
* Service Worker Configuration
  * After installation of service worker cache the templates of that page.
  * When user request this pages again block the request.
  * Fetch only of the page using `?contentOnly=true` parameter.
  * And finally render cached templates.
